# Introduction
Hi! I'm Mirza Azhan Bin Hazmirul a student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. 
Through the **Framework-Based Software Design and Development** course, I expect to strengthen my understanding of **maintaining and enhancing existing systems**, applying **framework-based solutions**, and working with **real-world software design patterns**.  
Iâ€™m also excited to learn how frameworks like **React, Flutter, and Node.js** can streamline software development in both web and mobile environments.
